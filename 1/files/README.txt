Congratulations on your downloading of the Toyota Supra for Need for Speed Porsche:2000/ Unleashed! I hope you enjoy it. Rook.


Installation:

-	Copy 'SupraRZ.crp' and 'SupraRZ.tpg'to your NFS:Porsche folder,  Gamedata/CarModel
-	Copy 'SupraRZ.sim'to Gamedata/Simulation
-	Copy '8SupraRZ.sav' to Savedata

IMPORTANT NOTES:

-	Due (I think) to the hires textures, this game crashes with more than approx. 3 'Same car' opponents.
-	Also with too much traffic/cops. Start small and build up.
-	Chrome patch is HIGHLY recommended. It hides some of the texture imperfections! :P
-	Has also crashed a couple of times for no apparent reason... mostly works again after reboot - weird.

This vehicle features:

-	Toyota Supra mesh from Need for Speed: Underground
-	Accurate performance (Car oversteers a bit too much off-throttle)
-	Working lights
-	Hires (1024*1024) & original textures (including carbon-fibre hood, steel wing end-plates and BBS wheels)
-	New paint schemes

The Supra does NOT feature:

-	Damage
-	Interior or moving parts
-	Brakes

Special thanks to the anonymous person who converted this car from NFS:U to Racer. Also to arushan for the crp filter which made this possible. Everyone else who contributed to light def discussions etc. Thanks guys!

This vehicle is NOT to be posted on another site without permission from The Rook. Permission is also required for texture use. See a Racer site for info about the mesh though.

This is my first ever model conversion or 3d model work, so please go easy! eg. I know nuthin' about normals. Anyway, I really hope you enjoy it!

Coming soon:

-	A more stock Supra with stock hood and different paint/ decal schemes. Also without the rear wing. WIll also contain some info about conversions for others, cos I learnt the hard way!


Merry Christmas! Rook
